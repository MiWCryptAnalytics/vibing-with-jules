Shady Merchant the He deals in rare and unusual items... for the right price. Always has a glint in his eye., brandishing their signature weapon (e.g., a flintlock, a cutlass, a mystical compass) with a defiant smirk.. with a painterly, almost impressionistic style, focusing on capturing the mood and essence of the character and setting rather than minute details, yet still clearly identifiable as PotC-themed.. The character's typical expressions and manner of speaking should inform their depicted personality and attitude.No text.
