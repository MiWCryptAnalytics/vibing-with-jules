An evocative scene depicting Salty Siren Tavern. The essence of this place is A somewhat disreputable tavern near the docks, known for strong drinks and loose talk. The air is thick with the smell of stale rum and sea salt. A 'Crow's Nest' gallery overlooks the main room... Epic fantasy art, cinematic lighting, highly detailed, reminiscent of concept art for a pirate adventure game.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
