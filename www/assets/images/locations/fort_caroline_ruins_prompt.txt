Fort Caroline Ruins The crumbling, vine-choked stone walls of an old colonial fort stand defiant against the encroaching jungle. Parrots screech from the canopy above, and the air is humid and thick with the scent of decay and damp stone. Cannon emplacements are now home to twisted trees, and the courtyard is a riot of tropical foliage. One can almost hear the clash of swords and the roar of cannons from a bygone era of colonial ambition and pirate raids.. Show its hidden depths.. A slightly fantastical and romanticized depiction, emphasizing the allure and danger of pirate legends.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
