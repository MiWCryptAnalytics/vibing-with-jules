The Leviathan's Ribcage, Colossal, bleached-white bones, encrusted with barnacles, arch dramatically from the turquoise water, forming a breathtaking natural gateway. These are said to be the ancient ribs of a long-dead Leviathan, a sea beast of unimaginable size. Sunlight filters through the gaps, illuminating the clear water below, where smaller creatures of the deep now make their home. The scale is humbling, a testament to the ocean's primordial power and its monstrous denizens.. Capture its unique atmosphere.. Impressionistic concept art, focusing on the overall mood and light, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly dreamlike quality.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
