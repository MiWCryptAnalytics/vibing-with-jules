Marooner's Rock, A desolate, sun-scorched rock jutting from the vast, empty ocean, offering no shelter or sustenance. Bleached driftwood and the bones of seabirds are its only adornments. Here, mutineers and pirate code-breakers were left with a bottle of rum and a pistol with a single shot to face their grim fate under a merciless sun. The silence is profound, broken only by the cries of gulls and the lapping of waves against its unforgiving shores.. Capture its unique atmosphere.. Epic fantasy art, cinematic lighting, highly detailed, reminiscent of concept art for a pirate adventure game.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
