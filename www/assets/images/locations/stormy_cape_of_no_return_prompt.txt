An evocative scene depicting Stormy Cape of No Return. The essence of this place is A treacherous, windswept cape where jagged black cliffs are constantly battered by furious, dark green waves. The sky above is a maelstrom of bruised purple clouds, and the air crackles with lightning. The bleached bones of countless ships litter the shores, a grim testament to the cape's violent, sudden storms. The roar of the thunder and the shriek of the wind are deafening... Stylized realism, similar to high-end video game environments, with rich detail, dynamic lighting, and a strong sense of place.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
