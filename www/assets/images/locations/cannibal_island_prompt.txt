Cannibal Island A dense, steamy jungle island, marked by crude, leering skull totems staked into the blood-red earth at the beach. The air is heavy with the scent of unknown blossoms and something more sinister. Drums echo from deep within the oppressive foliage, and the unsettling feeling of being watched is palpable. Broken human bones are scattered amongst the undergrowth. Best to steer clear, lest ye become part of the grisly decorations.. Show its hidden depths.. Gritty and realistic, focusing on the harsh beauty of the pirate world, weathered textures, and dramatic skies.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
