Port Royal Market A bustling marketplace filled with merchants and goods from across the seas. You can almost smell the spices and hear the bartering.. Show its hidden depths.. A slightly fantastical and romanticized depiction, emphasizing the allure and danger of pirate legends.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
