Sea Serpent's Pass, A narrow, winding channel cutting through towering, seaweed-strewn cliffs. The currents here are strong and unpredictable. Local fishermen whisper tales of giant, scaled sea serpents with eyes like burning coals, their immense bodies gliding effortlessly through these waters, their passage marked by disturbed waves and the cries of frightened seabirds. The air is heavy with the smell of salt and the unknown depths.. Capture its unique atmosphere.. A slightly fantastical and romanticized depiction, emphasizing the allure and danger of pirate legends.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
