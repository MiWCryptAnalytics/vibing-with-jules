Hidden Falls Cache Behind a thundering curtain of water lies a damp, mossy cave. The constant roar of the falls provides perfect cover for a secret meeting place or a hidden stash. Water drips from the ceiling, and the air is cool and earthy.. Show its hidden depths.. Stylized realism, similar to high-end video game environments, with rich detail, dynamic lighting, and a strong sense of place.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
