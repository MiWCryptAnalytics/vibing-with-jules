An evocative scene depicting Treasure Fleet Wreckage Site. The essence of this place is The scattered, barnacle-encrusted remains of a once-mighty Spanish treasure fleet lie strewn across a shallow, sandy seabed, shimmering in the dappled sunlight. Gold coins and silver goblets occasionally glint amidst the coral-covered cannons and splintered hulls. Colorful fish swim through the skeletal ribs of the galleons, lost to a furious hurricane centuries ago. The silence is broken only by the gentle sway of seaweed and the ghosts of frantic cries... A photorealistic matte painting, capturing the grandeur and atmosphere of a lost world, suitable for a blockbuster film.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
