A breathtaking panoramic view of Ship-Trap Island, which is known as A forbidding island ringed by dark, jagged rocks that possess a strange magnetic pull, yanking unsuspecting ships towards their doom upon the razor-sharp reefs. Treacherous currents swirl like hungry beasts around its shores. The skeletons of wrecked vessels, from humble fishing boats to proud warships, litter the coastline, their masts like grasping claws. The air hums with an unnatural energy... A beautifully detailed illustration, as if taken from the pages of an old adventurer's journal, with intricate details and annotations (though no actual text).. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
