Port Aurora A fortified colonial port town, fiercely loyal to the Crown. Orderly streets, stone buildings, and the constant presence of red-coated soldiers mark it as a bastion of authority. The Jolly Roger is not welcome here.. Show its hidden depths.. Cinematic wide shot, focusing on the scale and scope of the landscape, with a dramatic sky and atmospheric effects like fog or god rays.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
