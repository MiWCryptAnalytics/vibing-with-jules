Mermaid's Rock, A cluster of sun-bleached, jagged rocks rising from turquoise waters, draped with vibrant seaweed. Sailors claim to hear enchanting, irresistible songs carried on the salty breeze, luring ships to their doom. Rainbow-hued fish dart through the clear shallows, and the rocks shimmer with an otherworldly glow at sunset. Perhaps a glint of scales can be seen in the surf.. Capture its unique atmosphere.. Stylized realism, similar to high-end video game environments, with rich detail, dynamic lighting, and a strong sense of place.. No text, no words, no letters, no characters, no people, no animals, no ships, no boats unless explicitly part of the location's description. Focus on the environment and atmosphere.
