# Idea: Create 'The Legend of Mad Maddie' Questline

This issue is for the design and implementation of "'The Legend of Mad Maddie' Questline," inspired by Idea 41 in `brainstorm.md`.

**Core Concept:**
This will be a story-driven quest where players delve into the lore of a famous, eccentric pirate captain known as "Mad Maddie." Players will follow a trail of clues found in old sea shanties, tavern tales, forgotten letters, or cryptic maps to uncover the truth behind her legend, her fate, and potentially the location of her renowned lost treasure.

**Key Features:**
*   **Narrative Focus:** A strong emphasis on storytelling, character development (of Mad Maddie, even if posthumously), and unfolding mystery.
*   **Clue Progression:** Players will gather and interpret a series of clues. Each clue should lead to the next, creating a sense of investigation and discovery.
*   **Diverse Clue Sources:** Clues could be obtained through:
    *   Listening to bards sing specific shanties in taverns.
    *   Overhearing conversations or actively interrogating knowledgeable NPCs.
    *   Finding journal entries, logbooks, or marked charts.
    *   Solving riddles related to Maddie's life or habits.
*   **Unique Locations:** The quest should lead players to interesting and potentially new locations relevant to Mad Maddie's story.
*   **Satisfying Climax:** The questline should culminate in a significant revelation about Mad Maddie and/or the discovery of her treasure or legacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A compelling narrative for "Mad Maddie" is established.
*   A sequence of varied clues can be discovered by the player.
*   Interacting with specific NPCs, items, or locations progresses the questline.
*   The quest leads to unique environments or points of interest.
*   The questline has a clear beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution.
*   A meaningful reward or outcome is provided upon completion (e.g., treasure, unique item, significant lore unlocked).
