# Idea: Implement 'Custom Flag & Fear Factor' System

This issue covers the development of the "Custom Flag & Fear Factor" system, based on Idea 22 from `brainstorm.md`.

**Core Concept:**
Players will be able to design their own pirate flag using a predefined set of symbols, colors, and patterns. The design choices made by the player for their flag will have a tangible impact on gameplay, influencing how non-player characters (NPCs) react to them and affecting the "fear factor" or morale of enemy ships in naval encounters.

**Key Features:**
*   **Flag Customization Interface:** A user interface where players can select and combine various design elements (e.g., skulls, bones, mythical creatures, colors, backgrounds) to create their unique flag.
*   **NPC Reaction Logic:** Different flag elements or combinations should trigger varied reactions from different NPC factions or personalities. For example, a fearsome flag might intimidate merchants but attract aggressive pirates.
*   **Fear Factor Mechanic:** The player's flag design contributes to a "fear factor" that can influence enemy ship behavior in battles (e.g., chances of surrender, accuracy debuffs, willingness to engage).
*   **Reputation System Integration:** This system should tie into or complement a broader reputation system. The flag could be a visual representation of the player's notoriety or alignment.
*   **Visual Display:** The custom flag should be visibly displayed on the player's ship and potentially in other relevant UI elements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A flag customization UI is implemented with a variety of design elements.
*   The player's custom flag is displayed on their ship.
*   NPCs (or specific factions) show varied dialogue or behavioral reactions based on flag design.
*   A "fear factor" derived from the flag design demonstrably affects enemy ship behavior during encounters.
*   The system feels like a meaningful player expression with tangible gameplay consequences.
