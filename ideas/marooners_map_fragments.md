# Idea: Develop 'Marooner's Map Fragments' Quest

This issue tracks the implementation of the "Marooner's Map Fragments" quest, originating from Idea 4 in `brainstorm.md`.

**Core Concept:**
Players will collect multiple map fragments from different castaway NPCs. Each fragment not only contributes to a larger map but also comes with a unique story or piece of lore from the castaway who provides it. Completing a map by assembling its fragments will lead the player to a small, unique treasure hoard.

**Key Features:**
*   **Multiple Map Fragments:** Several distinct map fragments to be found/earned.
*   **Castaway NPCs:** Unique non-player characters (castaways) who possess these map fragments. Each should have a distinct personality and story related to their fragment.
*   **Dialogue System Integration:** Acquiring fragments will likely involve significant dialogue interaction, potentially persuasion, or completing small tasks for the castaways (fetch-quests).
*   **Story Snippets:** Each fragment or castaway interaction should reveal a small piece of a larger narrative or individual story.
*   **Unique Small Treasures:** Each completed map should lead to a distinct, modest treasure, appropriate for the effort involved. This could be unique items, currency, or crafting resources.
*   **Map Interface:** A way for players to view collected fragments and see how they fit together.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Multiple castaway NPCs are implemented, each holding a map fragment.
*   Dialogue and/or fetch-quests are in place to obtain fragments.
*   Each fragment and/or NPC interaction provides a narrative element.
*   A system for combining or viewing map fragments is available.
*   Successfully collecting all fragments for a given map leads to a discoverable treasure location.
*   Each treasure hoard provides a suitable reward.
