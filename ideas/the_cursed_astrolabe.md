# Idea: Implement 'The Cursed Astrolabe' Treasure Hunt

This issue is to track the development of "The Cursed Astrolabe" feature, based on Idea 1 from `brainstorm.md`.

**Core Concept:**
Players will embark on a treasure hunt for a legendary treasure that periodically shifts its location. Navigation to this treasure will require the use of a special "Cursed Astrolabe" that interprets alignments of cursed stars.

**Key Features:**
*   **Cursed Astrolabe Item:** A unique navigational tool that players must acquire.
*   **Shifting Treasure Location:** The target treasure's location should change based on in-game cosmic alignments (e.g., specific game days, times, or events).
*   **Star Chart Puzzles:** Players will need to solve puzzles related to star charts or celestial navigation to understand how the Astrolabe works or to pinpoint the treasure's current location.
*   **Island Exploration:** The treasure hunt will likely span multiple islands or require significant exploration of a large, detailed island.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Players can obtain the Cursed Astrolabe.
*   A mechanism exists for the treasure's location to change.
*   Star chart puzzles are implemented and solvable.
*   Players can successfully use the Astrolabe and puzzles to find the treasure.
*   The treasure provides a meaningful reward.
